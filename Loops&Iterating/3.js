let counter = 0;

while (counter = 1) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;

  if (counter > 2) {
    break;
  }
}

// is it becuase the while statment is never met? this question is confusing to me since I thought
// ok reading over the solution it makes sense since in javascript = and === are different the while (counter  = 1)
